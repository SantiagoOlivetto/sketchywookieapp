# Welcome to the Sketchy Wookiee App

This project was created with educational purposes only, in order to recreate a real e-commerce using ReactJs as framework.
This app sells Marvel comicbooks from Star wars universe, his commics were extracted from Marvels api for developers.
In order to learn how to create a real data base for this project I used Firebase, with Marvel api json file.
